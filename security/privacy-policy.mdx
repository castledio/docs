### What information does Castled collect

We at Castled, are a Customer Engagement Platform, which operationalises the
data in data warehouses including BigQuery and sync them to the operational
tools of your business. Also in order to compute deltas, we construct and use
some custom snapshot tables in an isolated and custom castled dataset on the
configured project.

### How do we use the information

We fetch the results from the google cloud storage and sync them to the
operational tools, for instance, salesforce, hubspot, intercom etc by calling
their programming interfaces by transforming the data corresponding to the
format the tools understand.

### What information do we share?

We do not share the information with anyone.

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Entered`   | Number of users who entered this campaign                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Completed` | Number of users who completed the campaign successfully                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Skipped`   | Number of users for whom campaign could not be executed for some reason. For push notification this means push token for user not available, for email it could be that the user already unsubscribed from all campaigns etc. |
| `Failed`    | Number of users for whom the campaign run failed (after fixed retry attempts)                                                                                                                                                 |

Eventually once campaign is completed, `Entered` should match sum of `Completed`, `Skipped` and `Failed` users.

Castled enables you to leverage the customer 360 data in your Snowflake to
engage your customers across different channels like Email, SMS, Push and In-app
notifications.

### Permission Details

As a prerequisite access needs to be given to Castled for configuring Snowflake
as a source.Snowflake permissions are complex and there are many ways to
configure access for Castled. The script below is the minimum access
configuration required and follows Snowflake's best practices for creating
read-only roles in a role hierarchy.

The script below captures the minimal permissions required by CASTLED to use the
data available in the Snowflake warehouse. Please refer Snowflake best practices
for creating the required roles.

Scripts mentioned below covers the following

1. Creating a dedicated role **CASTLED_ROLE**.
2. Creating a dedicated user **CASTLED**.
3. Giving **READ ONLY** access to the user **CASTLED** to access all the current
   as well as future tables and views of the required schemas in your database.
4. Creating a book keeping schema **CASTLED** with in your database and giving
   full access to that schema.

```
-----------------------------------ROLE CREATION STARTS---------------------------------------------------------
-- Create a role for the CASTLED user
    CREATE ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;
-----------------------------------ROLE CREATION ENDS-----------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------USER CREATON STARTS----------------------------------------------------------
-- Create the CASTLED user
    CREATE USER CASTLED WITH DEFAULT_ROLE = CASTLED_ROLE PASSWORD = ‘<STRONG_PASSWORD>’;

-- Grant the role CASTLED_ROLE to the CASTLED user
    GRANT ROLE CASTLED_ROLE TO USER CASTLED;
-----------------------------------USER CREATON ENDS------------------------------------------------------------


----IF YOU DECIDE YOU USE A WAREHOUSE OTHER THAN COMPUTE_WH, CREATE YOUR WAREHOUSE AS BELOW
-----------------------------------WAREHOUSE CREATON STARTS----------------------------------------------------------
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS "<your_warehouse>" warehouse_size = xsmall warehouse_type = standard auto_suspend = 60 auto_resume = true initially_suspended = true;
 -----------------------------------WAREHOUSE CREATON ENDS------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------GRANT WAREHOUSE ACCESS STARTS------------------------------------------
-- Grant Usage on the warehouse to CASTLED_ROLE. This will allow the CASTLED user to run all the required queries in this warehouse.
-- Mention your warehouse name, if you are using COMPUETE_WH mention COMPUTE_WH
 GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE "<your_warehouse>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant OPERATE privilege on the warehouse to CASTLED_ROLE. This is required to start/stop the warehouse and also to abort any running queries in the warehouse.
-- Mention your warehouse name, if you are using COMPUETE_WH mention COMPUTE_WH
 GRANT OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE "<your_warehouse>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;
-----------------------------------GRANT WAREHOUSE ACCESS ENDS------------------------------------------

-- Allow CASTLED_ROLE to access your database
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<your_database>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Allow CASTLED_ROLE to access your schema
-- GRANT access to all the schemas used in the query, if the query spans multiple schemas
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant READ ONLY access to CASTLED_ROLE for all the existing tables in your schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant READ ONLY access to CASTLED_ROLE for all the future tables created in your schema
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant READ ONLY access to CASTLED_ROLE for all the existing views in your schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant READ ONLY access to CASTLED_ROLE for all the future views created in your schema
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant READ ONLY access to CASTLED_ROLE for all the existing functions in your schema
GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;

-- Grant READ ONLY access to CASTLED_ROLE for all the future functions created in your schema
GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA "<your_database>"."<your_schema>" TO ROLE CASTLED_ROLE;
-----------------------------------GRANT TABLE READ ONLY ACCESS ENDS--------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------CREATE AND GRANT BOOK KEEPING ACCESS STARTS----------------------------------
-- Create a book keeping schema castled to store sync state
 CREATE SCHEMA "<your_database>"."castled";

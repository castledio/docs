## User Events

The `track` call lets you record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with any associated properties. The events collected can be used a trigger for campaigns/workflows and also synced to your data warehouse.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
castledanalytics.track(
  "Added to Cart",
  {
    value: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    item: "product A",
  },
  () => {
    console.log("in track call")
  }
)
```

- **event-name** is a string to identify the user event
- **properties** is a flat-map of event properties

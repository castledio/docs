</Info>

React Native is a JavaScript library for building apps on multiple platforms like Android and iOS, by maintaining a single code base.

**Castled React Native SDK** enables your React Native App to receive push, in-app and inbox notifications originating from the Castled Customer Engagement Platform.
It is implemented as a [**Turbo Native Module**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/the-new-architecture/pillars-turbomodules) with backward compatability. Turbo Native Modules
are the next iteration on React Native Modules for apps based on the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page).

<Note>
  If your react app is on legacy architecture, you will still be able to use the
  Castled SDK as Turbo Native Modules are backward compatible.
</Note>

## Installation

To use the SDK, add the library to your project

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
  npm install castled-react-native-sdk
```

```bash yarn
  yarn add castled-react-native-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Native Setup

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Android">
      
        #### Step 1.  Update `build.gradle`

        Include `google-services` plugin dependency in top-level gradle file

        ```gradle android/build.gradle
        // Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
        buildscript {
            repositories {
                // Add google maven repository
                google()
            }
            ...
            dependencies {
                ...
                classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:<plugin-version>")
            }
        }
        ```
        Apply `google-services` plugin to app gradle file

        ```gradle android/app/build.gradle
          apply plugin: "com.google.gms.google-services"

          ```
        #### Step 2. Add required permissions
        By default `AndroidManifest.xml` of the SDK includes the following permission requests. No developer action is required here.

        ```xml
        <!-- Castled SDK needs this permission to sync user token and campaign events  -->
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
        <!-- Castled SDK will use this permission to decide when to make network calls -->
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
        ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="iOS">
        #### Step 1: Pod Installation

           Navigate to ios directory of your app project and run `pod install`

            <Warning>
            When integrating a Swift library such as **Castled** into a React Native project, you may encounter an issue during the pod install process.
            This issue arises because Swift pods, including **Castled**, depend on libraries which do not define modules.
            In React Native projects, integrating Swift pods as static libraries requires the generation of module maps for proper Swift compatibility.

            To resolve this issue, follow these steps to configure your Podfile:

            ```pod
            target 'YourTargetName' do
              config = use_native_modules!
              pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 5.11', :modular_headers => true
              pod 'Realm', :modular_headers => true
            end
            ```
            Save the Podfile and run `pod install` again.
            </Warning>
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Initialization

Next step is to initialize the SDK. Initialization is typically done in `App.js`.

```tsx
  import * as React from 'react';
  // Importing SDK modules required for initialization
  import {
    CastledNotifications,
    CastledConfigs,
    CastledLocation,
  } from 'castled-react-native-sdk';
  import Header from './Header';

  export default function App() {

    ...

    React.useEffect(() => {
      // Set config
      const configs = new CastledConfigs();
      configs.appId = '<app-id>';
      configs.location = CastledLocation.US;

      // Initialize SDK
      CastledNotifications.initialize(configs);
    }, []);

    ...

    return (
      <>
        ...
      </>
    );
  }
```

- `api-key` is a unique key associated with your Castled account. It can be found in the Castled dashboard at **Settings > Api Keys**.
- `location` is the region where you have your Castled account.

You can refer to the **SDK Configs** section for the list of configs available during initialization.

### User Identification

To identify the user associated with this app instance, use the following method. This is typically invoked immediately after user completes the
sign-in flow of your app. `user-id` is the id that you use internally within your organisation to identify a user.

```tsx
// User identification
CastledNotifications.setUserId("<user-id>")
```

<Note>
  It is recommended to pass an optional **user-token** as the second parameter
  to `setUserId` to mitigate any risk of user impersonation. In the absence of a
  **user-token**, no additional verifications will be done to enforce user
  authenticity. If your **user-id** is random id such as a UUID, **user-token**
  is probably not required. More info on **user-token** can be found in the next
  section.
</Note>

### Secure User Identification

`user-token` is a unique token for each user generated by your app server. This token is usually issued by the app server after the user
is verified by the app server after login.

```tsx
// Secure user identification
CastledNotifications.setUserId("<user-id>", "<user-token>")
```

`user-token` is basically a Base64 encoded **Hash-based Message Authentication Code** (HMAC). Ensure the hash computation happens in your app server so that `api-key`
is not exposed. You can create an `api-key` in the **Setting > API Keys** page within your Castled account. Contact Castled support for help with integration.

Find sample server code snippets to generate **HMAC** for the `user-id`.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```java java
        import javax.crypto.Mac;
        import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
        import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
        import java.util.Base64;

        public static String calculateHMAC(String userId, String apiKey) throws Exception {
            // Get an instance of the HMAC using SHA-256 hashing algorithm
            Mac sha256Hmac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");

            // Create a SecretKeySpec using the provided key
            SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(apiKey.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), "HmacSHA256");

            // Initialize the Mac with the secret key
            sha256Hmac.init(secretKey);

            // Compute the HMAC of the given data
            byte[] rawHmac = sha256Hmac.doFinal(userId.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

            // Convert the HMAC bytes to a Base64 encoded string
            return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(rawHmac);
        }
    ```

    ```go go
        import (
            "crypto/hmac"
            "crypto/sha256"
            "encoding/base64"
            "fmt"
        )

        func calculateHMAC(message string, apiKey string) string {
            key := []byte(apiKey)
            h := hmac.New(sha256.New, key)
            h.Write([]byte(message))

            // Encoding the HMAC as a Base64 encoded string
            return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil))
        }
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

### User Logout

To remove the user association with a particular app instance. Typically invoked as part of the user sign-out flow within the app. Once invoked, app won't be able to
receive any messages or notifications sent from Castled until the user sign-in again to the app again.

```tsx
// User logout
CastledNotifications.logout()
```

## SDK Configs

This section covers the basic configurations available in the `CastledConfigs` class of the SDK.
Use these configs if you want to enable specific messsaging channel or want to override default behavior.

| Config Name     | Description                                                                                       | Default Value |

| enableTracking  | Enables tracking of User attributes or App events                                                 | false         |
| location        | Preferred server location                                                                         | US            |

<Note>
  Push boost feature has to be included in your account plan for
  `enablePushBoost` to work as expected. For any inquiries or further
  assistance, please contact our support team.

</Info>

Use the `track` static method in Castled SDK to record user activity on your application. The events collected can be used a trigger for campaigns/workflows and also synced to your data warehouse.

```php
Castled::track([
        'event' => 'order_status_update',
        'userId' => '12345',
        'properties' => [
            'plan' => 'basic',
            'order_id' => 'o1'
        ]
    ]);
```

title: "Configuring & Downloading .p12 certificate"
---

### Introduction
This documentation will guide you through the process of creating and downloading a .p12 certificate, which is required for sending push notifications to your iOS application. The .p12 certificate establishes a secure connection with Apple's Push Notification service (APNs) and enables your server to send push notifications.

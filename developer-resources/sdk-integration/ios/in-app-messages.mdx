</Info>

Castled SDK allows you to show in-app messages to users who are currently engaging with your app. These messages are typically used to communicate important information,
deliver targeted promotions, provide user guidance, or engage with users within the app.

## Enabling In-App messages in SDK

1. Set the flag `enableInApp` to `true` when initializing the SDK

```swift
@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate , UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        let config = CastledConfigs.sharedInstance

        //Mandatory : enableInApp needs to be mandatorily set to true for in app support.
        config.enableInApp = true

        Castled.configure(registerIn: application,
            launchOptions: launchOptions,
            instanceId: "mytestapikey",
            delegate: self)

        return true
    }
}
```

2. User Registration

Once the user registration is complete, the app should invoke the registerUser API in Castled SDK to register the user and the device token with the backend service.App developer to make sure the below API is called at the appropriate time in the sequence of events.

```swift
Castled.registerUser(userId: '<userId>', apnsToken: '<device-token>')
```

## Triggering In-App SDK events

In-App messages are typically shown in response to events that happen within your app. You can decide the trigger
event for in-app display when creating the campaign. By default SDK tracks `app_opened` and `page_viewed` events. Note that these events
are not reported to our sever and is used only to determine if an in-app needs to be shown or not.

If you want to use a custom event as the trigger event, SDK provides a method to raise such an event based on a user action within your app.

```swift
Castled.logCustomAppEvent(context : UIViewController,eventName : String ,params : eventParams,showLog : Bool? = true)
```

- eventName : name of the custom event.
- params : event parameters as a key value pair
- showLog : a flag to enable showing the log of the event

For e.g. If your shopping app wants to display an in-app message when value of items in cart greater than a certain number, app would log
a custom event as follows whenever user adds an item to cart.

```swift
// Name of event: added_to_cart
// Event params:
//     value: total value of items in cart
//     items: total number of items in cart
Castled.logCustomAppEvent(
            context,
            "added_to_cart",
            ["value" : 1400, "items" : 10 , "currency" : "USD"],
            true)
```

SDK will then make sure of displaying the eligible in-app to user if there is one.

## Skipping InApps in Activity

This is useful when you want to skip showing InApps when user is on specific screens within your app. For e.g. Splash screens, Checkout screen, etc.

You can add a list of view controllers you want to exclude from InApp notifications by adding a key in the plist `CastledExcludedInAppViews`.

<Note>
The recommended approach for iOS, especially if you are using custom root view controllers other than the default UINavigationController or UITabBarController, is to use the following **Managing InApp Rendering** methods.
</Note>

## Managing InApp Rendering

You can use the following methods to override the default InApp behaviour.

### Pausing InApp

<CodeGroup>

    ```swift swift
    Castled.sharedInstance.pauseInApp()
    ```

    ```objc objc
    [[Castled sharedInstance] pauseInApp];
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Any new InApps which are ready for display are not shown to users and added to a waiting queue. This can be used to not interrupt users when they are
performing any critical activity within your app.

### Resuming InApp

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```swift swift 
  Castled.sharedInstance.resumeInApp() 
  ``` 
  
  ```objc objc 
  [[Castled sharedInstance] resumeInApp]; 
  ```

</CodeGroup>

InApp display behaviour goes back to normal. If there are any InApps which are previously paused, they get displayed.

### Stopping InApps

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```swift swift 
  Castled.sharedInstance.stopInApp() 
  ``` 
  
  ```objc objc 
  [[Castled sharedInstance] stopInApp]; 
  ```

</CodeGroup>

This method stops all InApp messages from displaying until a `resumeInApp` is invoked. Unlike `pauseInApp`,
`stopInApp` completely stops evaluating the trigger condition for displaying InApp and all InApp that would have been displayed otherwise would be ignored.

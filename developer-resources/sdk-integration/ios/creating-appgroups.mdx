title: "Creating App Groups in Xcode"
---

### Introduction:
This section will guide you through the process of creating App Groups in Xcode, which are essential for sharing data between your main app and other extensions, such as Notification Service Extensions. App Groups allow different parts of your app to access shared containers and user defaults, enabling smooth communication and data synchronization.



1. Select your main target in Xcode.
2. Navigate to the Signing & Capabilities tab.
3. Click on + Capability to add a new capability.
4. In the popup, search for App Groups.
5. Click on App Groups to enable it.

7. Set the new container to be group.YOUR-BUNDLE-IDENTIFIER.batch, where YOUR-BUNDLE-IDENTIFIER is the bundle identifier of your main target.

Repeat steps 1-5 for any other targets, such as your Notification Service Extension, and select the same app group for them.

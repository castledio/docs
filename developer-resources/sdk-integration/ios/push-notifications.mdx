Castled provides a convenient way to send push notifications to your applications directly from our dashboard. Follow these steps to send your first push notification to your application:

### Configure Push Notification in App Target

**1. Capabilities -> Push Notifications:**
Enable Push Notifications in your app's target capabilities. This adds the required entitlements to your app.

**2. Capabilities -> Background Modes:**

Enable Background Modes and check **Remote notifications**. This allows your app to be woken up from a push notification.

**3. Set Up App Groups (Optional):**

If your app uses extensions, you may need to set up an App Group so that data can be shared between the main app and its extensions.

The name of your app group should be **group.<your_bundle_id>.castled**.

This is not required for push notifications per se but is relevant if you have a **Notification Service Extension** for rich notifications or need to manage a shared container of data.

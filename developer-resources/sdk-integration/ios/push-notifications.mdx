Castled provides a convenient way to send push notifications to your applications directly from our dashboard. Follow these steps to send your first push notification to your application:

<Note>

**Prerequisite**

To enable push notifications on your iOS application using the Castled dashboard, you are required to upload the APNS Authentication Key obtained from your Apple Developer account. There are two available methods to configure push notifications.

Refer [here](/developer-resources/sdk-integration/ios/configuring-p8) for more information on how to obtain **.p8 file**.

</Note>

### Configuring App Target for Push Notification

To enable push notifications for your iOS app, you need to configure the app's target settings in Xcode. This involves adding an App Group ID, enabling remote notifications, and activating the push notifications capability.

Follow the steps below to set up these features in the Signing & Capabilities tab of your app target:

**1. Enabling Push Notifications Capability**

To receive push notifications, you must explicitly enable this capability.To enable push notification :

1. Still on the Signing & Capabilities tab, click the "+" button to add a new capability.
2. Search for "Push Notifications" and add it.
3. Ensure that the Push Notifications capability is checked.

**2. Enabling Remote Notifications**

Remote notifications are essential for receiving notifications from a server.This will allow your app to be awakened in the background to receive notifications.

To enable Remote notifications :

1. Within the Signing & Capabilities tab, ensure that the Background Modes capability is present.
2. If not, add it by clicking the "+" button and selecting "Background Modes."
3. In the Background Modes section, find and check the "Remote notifications" option.

<Note>
It is advised to enabling Remote Notifications for efficient **Uninstall tracking** and **Delivery Status tracking** even in cases where app is in the background, not running or inactive.
</Note>

**3. Adding an App Group ID**

App Groups facilitate the sharing of data between multiple apps developed by the same organization and their extensions. While this is not required specifically for push notifications, it is relevant if you have any notification-related extensions for rich notifications or need to manage a shared container of data.

To add an App Group:

1. Open your project in Xcode and select the app target.
2. Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab.
3. Click on the "+" button to add a new capability.
4. Type "App Groups" in the search bar and select it from the list.
5. Under the App Groups section, click the "+" to create a new group.
6. Enter the App Group ID using the format **group.your_bundle_id.castled**.
7. Make sure the App Group ID is checked to enable it.

<Note>
To ensure proper integration, we recommend setting up a separate App Group ID specifically for Castled.The format should be **group.your_bundle_id.castled**. Make sure to enable this same App Group ID for all targets where Castled is utilized.
</Note>

### Registering Push Notification 

In iOS 10 and above, to handle push notifications, you need to implement the following method from **UIApplicationDelegate** protocol and add the three steps mentioned in the code snippet below for registering push notification.

**application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)**

This method is called when the app finishes launching. You can use this method to register for remote notifications and configure the notification settings.

<CodeGroup>
```swift swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate , UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        //1. Configure config
        let config = CastledConfigs.initialize(appId: "<App ID>")
        config.enablePush  = true
        config.appGroupId = "<your_app_group_id>"

        //2. Call Castled.initialize method
        Castled.initialize(withConfig: config, andDelegate: self)

        //3. Register Push 
        registerForPush()
         

        return true
    }

    func registerForPush() {

        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self

        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.sound, .badge, .alert], completionHandler: {granted, error in
            if granted {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
                }
            }
        })
    }
}
```

```objc objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <Castled/Castled-Swift.h>
#import <UserNotifications/UserNotifications.h>

@interface AppDelegate ()<UIApplicationDelegate,UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate,CastledNotificationDelegate>
{

}
@end

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    //1. Configure config
    CastledConfigs *config = [CastledConfigs initializeWithAppId:@"<App ID>"];
    config.enablePush = TRUE;
    config.appGroupId = @"<your_app_group_id>";

    //2. Call Castled.initialize method
   [Castled initializeWithConfig:config andDelegate:self];

    //3. Register Push
    [self registerForPush];

    
    return YES;
}

- (void)registerForPush {
    UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
    center.delegate = (id)self;
    [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge) completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError * _Nullable error){
        if( !error ){
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void) {
                [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
            });
        }
    }];
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**Adding App Group ID to config**

Make sure the App group ID configured in the Signed & Capabilities tab of the app's target is added to the config as mentioned below.

<CodeGroup>
```swift swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    let config = CastledConfigs.initialize(appId: "<App ID>")   
    ...
    config.appGroupId = "group.com.castled.CastledPushDemo.Castled"
    ...
    Castled.initialize(withConfig: config, andDelegate: self)
    ...
    return true
}
```

```objc objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    ...
    CastledConfigs config = [CastledConfigs initializeWithInstanceId:@"<App Id>"];
    ...
    config.appGroupId = @"group.com.castled.CastledPushDemo.Castled";
    ...

    [Castled initializeWithConfig:config andDelegate:self];
    ...
    return YES;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Requesting User Permission for Push Notifications

Obtaining user authorization is a crucial requirement for sending push notifications to an iOS application. When your app requests authorization for the first time, the system presents a prompt to the user, giving them the choice to grant or deny the request. The user's response is then recorded by the system for future reference.

### AppDelegate Swizzling in Castled SDK

Castled SDK is designed to simplify push notification handling. By default, swizzling is **enabled**, which means the SDK automatically handles the registration of device tokens, the presentation of notifications, and the response to user interactions with those notifications. 

For details on utilizing callback methods after swizzling, which enable developers to implement custom behaviors or logic following the Castled SDK's default notification lifecycle handling, refer to [this section](/developer-resources/sdk-integration/ios/swizzling#callback-methods-post-swizzling) 

### Disabling AppDelegate Swizzling

To disable method swizzling with Castled SDK, you must update the **Info.plist** file of your application. Add a new key-value pair where the key is specific to the Castled SDK’s configuration and the value explicitly indicates that swizzling should be turned off. 

Refer to [this section](/developer-resources/sdk-integration/ios/swizzling#disabling-swizzling-in-castled-sdk) for instructions on how to disable swizzling in the Castled SDK, as well as how to manually handle push notifications afterwards.

## Custom handling of User Actions 

The Castled SDK provides support for handling custom notification actions when the user interacts with push notifications in your application. By implementing the CastledNotificationDelegate protocol in your AppDelegate class, you can define the behavior for different notification actions such as deeplinking, navigating to a specific screen, or displaying a rich landing page.

### CastledNotificationDelegate method

**notificationClicked**
This delegate method is invoked when a user clicks on a notification that was displayed as a result of a push notification sent from the Castled SDK. It provides detailed context about the notification that was clicked, allowing the application to handle different actions appropriately.

**Parameters:**

**type** : A CastledNotificationType indicating the type of notification. The values include 'push', 'inapp', 'inbox'.


**CastledButtonAction** : An optional type providing additional information associated with the notification, such as a URL to open or title to display,click action type etc...

**buttonAction.actionType** : A CastledClickActionType representing the action taken by the user. The values include:
- deepLink
- navigateToScreen
- richLanding
- requestForPush
- dismiss
- custom

**userInfo** : A dictionary containing the original notification payload. This includes the custom data that was sent with the notification for the application to use.

<CodeGroup>
```swift swift
// Implement the CastledNotificationDelegate methods
extension AppDelegate: CastledNotificationDelegate {

    func notificationClicked(withNotificationType type: CastledNotificationType, buttonAction: CastledButtonAction, userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any]) {
        /*
         CastledNotificationType
            0 .push
            1 .inapp
         */
        print("CastledNotificationType: \(type.rawValue)\nbuttonTitle: \(buttonAction.buttonTitle ?? "")\nactionUri:\(buttonAction.actionUri ?? "")\nkeyVals: \(buttonAction.keyVals)\ninboxCopyEnabled: \(buttonAction.inboxCopyEnabled)\nButtonActionType: \(buttonAction.actionType)")

        switch buttonAction.actionType {
            case .deepLink:
                if let urlString = buttonAction.actionUri, let url = URL(string: urlString) {
                    //handleDeepLink(url: url)
                }

            case .navigateToScreen:
                if let screenName = buttonAction.actionUri {
                   // handleNavigateToScreen(screenName: screenName)
                }
            case .richLanding:

### Configuring Notification Categories and Actions

Apps are required to enable support for actionable notifications. During app launch, it is necessary to register one or more notification categories that define the types of notifications your app sends. Each category is associated with specific actions that users can take when receiving a notification of that type. 

While each category can have up to four actions, the actual number of displayed actions may vary depending on the notification display. For instance, banners typically show a maximum of two actions.

**Registering the Notification Categories for Your App**

By passing the **notificationCategories** parameter, you can define a set of categories and associated actions for your notifications. Each category corresponds to a type of notification that your app can receive, and for each category, you can specify the actions that a user can take directly from the notification.

This flexibility allows app developers to create a rich and interactive notification experience, tailored to the needs of their application and its users.

<CodeGroup>
```swift swift
@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate , UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        ...

        // Register the Custom Notification categories & actions
        let notificationCategories = getNotificationCategories();
        Castled.sharedInstance.setNotificationCategories(withItems: notificationCategories)

        ...
        return true
    }

    func getNotificationCategories() -> Set<UNNotificationCategory> {
        // Create the custom actions
        let action1 = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "ACCEPT", 
                                        title: "Accept", 
                                        options: UNNotificationActionOptions.foreground)
        let action2 = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "DECLINE", 
                                        title: "Decline", 
                                        options: [])

        // Create the category with the custom actions

<br />

<Note>
The **UNNotificationActionOptions.foreground** in swift and **UNNotificationActionOptionForeground** in Objective C option is used to specify the behavior of a notification action when it is clicked by the user. Make sure this option is included, so that the action launches the application and bring it to the foreground.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Failed to register for remote notifications: No valid “aps-environment” entitlement string found for application">
    Ensure that push notification capability is enabled in **Xcode**. Navigate to the project file (.xcodeproj), go to **Capabilities**, 
    and enable Push Notification. This ensures the presence of the necessary `aps-environment` entitlement string for your application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Push notification is not showing in the device after sending from Castled dashboard">
    You can use the following checklist as a starter for debugging this issue.
    
    1. Ensure mobile device has network connection. 
    2. Make sure `enablePush` config is set to `true`.
    3. If the app was uninstalled, the token becomes invalid. Ensure that the app is installed on the device.
    4. APNS configs are setup in Castled dashboard.
    5. Make sure app has granted push notification permission. You can navigate to **Settings > Notifications > Your App** to see the notification permission status.
    6. If you are sending notification using a **Campaign** or **Workflow**, check out the **Reports** section for the **Campaign** or **Workflow**. If you see `Skipped` counter is non zero, 
       it likely means SDK was not able to send push token to Castled server. Try removing the app and re-installing. If problem persists contact support.  
    7. If you are getting a specific error message when sending test push notification, checkout the faq section about common error codes.
    8. If you already tried the above checklist and the problem still persists, reach out to `tech@castled.io` or ping us in our Slack channel.
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Common error codes when sending test push notification">
   
   #### BadDeviceToken
   If you encounter a BadDeviceToken issue, there are two potential causes related to sandbox configuration:
   1. Sandbox selection in Castled dashboard:
      Ensure that the sandbox environment is correctly selected in the Castled dashboard under **Settings -> Channels -> Mobile Push -> iOS**. 
      The environment chosen should align with your development or testing phase.
   
   2. Send to sandbox selection in send test push:
      When sending test push, make sure that the **Send to Sandbox** option is selected. If you're testing in a sandbox environment, enable this option to direct notifications to the sandbox APNS servers. 
      Conversely, for production testing, ensure that this option is disabled.

   #### TopicDisallowed

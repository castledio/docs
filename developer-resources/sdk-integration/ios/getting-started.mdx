## Setting up iOS configs

You can either use a **APNS Provider Certificate** or **APNS Authentication Key** to configure iOS push notification in Castled.

<Note>
  **APNS Authentication Key** is the recommended method for sending push
  notfication to your apps running on iOS devices. It use token based
  authentication and is faster than the certificate based one. This doc has
  instructions on how to generate an **Authentication Key**
</Note>

## Uing APNS Authentication Key

This [doc](/getting-started/channel-setup/ios-auth) has more information on how to obtain **Auth key file**, **Key ID**, **Team ID** and **Bundle ID**.

## Using APNS Provider Certificate

To generate the certificate and the private key you can follow the instructions provided in the [apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)

Once you save the configs in Castled, you will get an `instance-id` which will be later used while integrating the SDK with your app.

## SDK installation

### Install from CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on macOS.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

List the dependencies in a text file named `Podfile` in your Xcode project directory. If you do not have a `Podfile` already create one using the following command.

```
pod init
```

To integrate Castled Notifications into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`

```bash Podfile
pod 'Castled', '~> 1.0.2'
```

Now you can install the dependencies in your project.

```
pod install
```

When installation is complete open the .xcworkspace that was created.

## Completing the initialisation

Import your dependencies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Swift">
    ```
    import Castled
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Objective C">
    ```
    #import <Castled/Castled-Swift.h>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Initialize the SDK by passing the `app id` in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of the `AppDelegate` class

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Swift">

    ```
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
      ...
      let config = CastledConfigs.initialize(apiKey: "<api key>")

      Castled.initialize(withConfig: config, delegate: self, andNotificationCategories: nil)
      ...
      return true      }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Objective C">

    ```
    @interface AppDelegate ()<UIApplicationDelegate,UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate,CastledNotificationDelegate>
    {

    }
    @end

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

        CastledConfigs *config = [CastledConfigs initializeWithInstanceId:@"<App Id>"];

        [Castled initializeWithConfig:config delegate:(id)self andNotificationCategories:nil];

        return YES;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

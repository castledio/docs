## Setting up iOS configs

You can either use a **APNS Provider Certificate** or **APNS Authentication Key** to configure iOS push notification in Castled.

<Note>
  **APNS Authentication Key** is the recommended method for sending push
  notfication to your apps running on iOS devices. It use token based
  authentication and is faster than the certificate based one. This doc has
  instructions on how to generate an **Authentication Key**
</Note>

## Uing APNS Authentication Key

This [doc](/getting-started/channel-setup/ios-auth) has more information on how to obtain **Auth key file**, **Key ID**, **Team ID** and **Bundle ID**.

## Using APNS Provider Certificate

To generate the certificate and the private key you can follow the instructions provided in the [apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)

Once you save the configs in Castled, you will get an `instance-id` which will be later used while integrating the SDK with your app.

### Install from CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on macOS.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

List the dependencies in a text file named `Podfile` in your Xcode project directory. If you do not have a `Podfile` already create one using the following command.

```
pod init
```

To integrate Castled Notifications into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`

```bash Podfile
pod 'Castled'
```

Now you can install the dependencies in your project.

```
pod install
```

When installation is complete open the .xcworkspace that was created.

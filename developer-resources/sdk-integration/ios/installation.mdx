### Install from CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on macOS.

1. **Install CocoaPods:**

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
2.**Initialize a Podfile:**

Navigate to your Xcode project directory. If you don't have a Podfile already, initialize one:

```
pod init
```

3. **Add Castled Notifications to your Podfile:**

Open the Podfile in a text editor and specify Castled Notifications:

```bash Podfile
pod 'Castled'
```

4. **Install the Dependencies:**

Now, run the following command to install Castled Notifications:

```
pod install
```

5. **Open the Workspace:**

After the installation is complete, make sure to open the .xcworkspace file created by CocoaPods, as it includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

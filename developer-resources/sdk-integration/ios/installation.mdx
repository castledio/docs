## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on macOS.

1. **Install CocoaPods:**

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

2.**Initialize a Podfile:**

Navigate to your Xcode project directory. If you don't have a Podfile already, initialize one:

```
pod init
```

3. **Add Castled Notifications to your Podfile:**

Open the Podfile in a text editor and specify Castled Notifications:

```bash Podfile
pod 'Castled'
```

4. **Install the Dependencies:**

Now, run the following command to install Castled Notifications:

```
pod install
```

5. **Open the Workspace:**

After the installation is complete, make sure to open the .xcworkspace file created by CocoaPods, as it includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

## Installation with Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)

**Swift Package Manager** (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Castled as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift` file.

```swift Package.swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
    .package(url: “https://github.com/castledio/castled-ios-sdk”, .upToNextMajor(from: “x.y.z"))
    ],
    // ...
)
```

`x.y.x` is the semantic version of the Castled SDK being installed.

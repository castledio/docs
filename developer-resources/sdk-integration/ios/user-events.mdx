`logCustomEvent` method can be used to log user events. Any params associated with the events is passed to the method as a flatmap.

        ```swift swift
        Castled.sharedInstance.logCustomAppEvent("Test Event", params: ["Int": 100, "DOB": "12-16-2000", "Name": "Antony"])
        ```

        ```objc objc
        [[Castled sharedInstance] logCustomAppEvent:@"Test Event" params:@{@"Int": @100,
                                                                       @"DOB": @"12-16-2000",
                                                                       @"Name": @"Antony"}];
        ```

These events can be used as the **trigger events** for your push, inapp and inbox campaigns or workflows. Also can be used to create user segments for your future campaigns.

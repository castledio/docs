## Setting up FCM configs in Castled

We need to get the **FCM Sender ID** and **FCM Server Key** from Firebase
console which will be required for configuring the Android app in Castled.

1. After logging into Firebase console, navigate to project settings page for
   your project and select cloud messaging tab. Add a new server key if not
   already done.

   **Manage API in Google Cloud Console** button to enable it.

   push** in Castled webapp. Select Android tab. Specify an **App Name** and **Package Name** to
   identify your app configuration and enter the **FCM Sender ID** and **FCM
   Server Key** you got from Firebase console in the previous step.

Xiaomi MiPush is a push notification service provided by Xiaomi for its smartphones and for developers who have apps on these devices. It is recommended to setup **MiPush** if your app is installed on Xiaomi devices.
Castled will use **MiPush** as a fallback channel to Google FCM for sending push notifications thereby ensuring better delivery rates.

## **Step 1:** Create Xiaomi Developer Account

1. Visit the [Xiaomi Developer website](https://dev.mi.com/).
2. Click on the **Sign Up** button usually located at the top right of the page.
3. Enter your email address and create a password. Click the **Sign Up** button.
4. You will receive a verification email from Xiaomi. Open this email and click on the verification link to verify your email address.
5. After verifying your email, you can sign in to the Xiaomi Developer website with your new account.
6. You may need to fill in additional information about yourself or your company, agree to Xiaomi's developer terms of service, and possibly pay a registration fee (if applicable).
7. After this, your application will typically be reviewed by Xiaomi. Once your application is approved, you will have access to Xiaomi's developer resources, including the Mi Push service.

## **Step 2:** Xiaomi App Setup

1. Create a new app in [Xiaomi Push Operational Console](https://admin.xmpush.xiaomi.com/). You can log in using your credentials from step 1.
2. Enable push notification for the app.

## **Step 4:** App SDK Setup

<Note>
  Following steps are in addition to the general [push notification
  setup](/developer-resources/sdk-integration/android/push-notifications)
</Note>

1. First, copy the AAR package of the **MiPush** SDK, `MiPush_SDK_Client_5_1_8-G_3rd.aar`, to the project `/libs/` directory, and then to the `build.gradle` of the project app module dependency.
   Also add Castled library for handling Xiaomi push.

   ```groovy build.gradle
   implementation "io.castled.android:castled-mipush:<latest-version>"  // Replace <latest-version> with latest available version of castled-mipush library
   implementation files("libs/MiPush_SDK_Client_5_1_8-G_3rd.aar")
   ```

2. Initialize `xiaomiAppId` and `xiaomiAppKey` in SDK with `AppID` and `AppKey` obtained in **Step 2**.

   ```kotlin

   // SDK initialization
   CastledNotifications.initialize(
       this, CastledConfigs.Builder()
           .apiKey("<castled-api-key>")
           .location(<location>)
           .xiaomiAppId("<xiaomi-app-id>")   // Xiaomi App ID
           .xiaomiAppKey("<xiaomi-app-key>") // Xiaomi App Key
           .enablePush(true)
           .build()
   )
   ```

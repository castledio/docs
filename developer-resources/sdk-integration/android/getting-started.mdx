The Castled Android SDK enables mobile applications running on Android devices to receive push and in-app notifications originating from the Castled Customer Engagement Platform.
The steps outlined below will assist your Android app developers in integrating the SDK with your mobile application

## SDK installation

### Gradle

Applicable if your project uses **Gradle** for managing dependency. Add Castled module as a dependency in the `build.gradle` file of your Android
application module

```groovy build.gradle
...
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'io.castled.android:castled-notifications:<sdk-latest-version>'
}
```

Replace `latest-version` with the latest version number of the SDK found here.

### Maven

Applicable if your project uses **Maven** for managing dependency. Add the following snippet in your module `pom.xml` file as a child of `dependencies`

```xml pom.xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.castled.android</groupId>
  <artifactId>castled-notifications</artifactId>
  <version>sdk-latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace `sdk-latest-version` with the latest version of the sdk.

## SDK initialization

The next step is to initialize the SDK. Initialization is typically done in the `onCreate` method of your
`Application` class as follows.

```kotlin MyApplicationClass.kt
class MyApplicationClass : MultiDexApplication() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // SDK initialization
        CastledNotifications.initialize(
            this, CastledConfigs.Builder()
                .apiKey("<api-key>")
                .location(<location>)
                .build()
        )
        ...
    }
    ...
}

```

`api-key` is the unique id associated with your Castled account.

`location` is the region where you have your Castled account. Currently we offer services in 4 regions

```kotlin CastledConfigs.kt
    enum class CastledLocation {
        US,   // United States
        EU,   // Europe
        IN,   // India
        AP    // Asia Pacific
    }
```

### User Identification

To let Castled know the user associated with this app instance, use the
following method. This is typically invoked immediately after user completes the
sign-in flow of your app. The `user-id` passed to Castled is the one that you
use internally within your organisation to identify a user.

```kotlin
// User identification
CastledNotifications.setUserId(this, "frank@castled.io", this::onSuccess, this::onError)
```

`onSuccess` and `onError` are optional callbacks you can get implement to get notified of the status of the identify process. Sample implementation below.

```kotlin
private fun onSuccess() {
    Log.d("MyApp","Castled user identify completed successfully")
}

private fun onError(e: Exception) {
    Log.e("MyApp", "Castled user identify failed!", e)
}
```

`user-id` can optionally be an encrypted one which is generated from your
app server using the Castled secret. This is the recommended approach to avoid any risks of user
impersonation. If using encrypted user-id, set `enableUserIdEncryption` to `true` in configs during SDK initialization.
Default value of this config is set to `false`.

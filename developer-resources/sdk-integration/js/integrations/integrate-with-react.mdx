Follow the steps below to integrate **Castled JS SDK** with your **React** app.

## Install the SDK

To install the SDK via npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm install castled-js-sdk --save
```

## Integration with the project

1. Create the following file in the `src` directory within your React project

   ```ts useCastledAnalytics.ts
   import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
   import * as castledanalytics from "castled-js-sdk"

   const useCastledAnalytics = (): any => {
     const [analytics, setAnalytics] = useState<any>()

     useEffect(() => {
       if (!analytics) {
         castledanalytics.load("<APP-ID>", "<SERVER-URL>")
         castledanalytics.ready(() => {
           setAnalytics(castledanalytics)
           console.log("Castled analytics initialization complete")
         })
       }
     }, [analytics])

     return analytics
   }

   export default useCastledAnalytics
   ```

   - `APP-ID` is a unique id associated with your Castled workspace. It can be found in the Castled dashboard at **Settings > Api Keys**.
   - `SERVER-URL` is the cluster url where the events are initially send to. `https://api.castled.io` is the default value of this url.

2. Sample code snippet below shows how you would use the `useCastledAnalytics` method created in previous step for tracking user events.

   ```tsx
   import { useEffect } from "react"
   import useCastledAnalytics from "./useCastledAnalytics"

   const EventTrackingDemo = () => {
     const analytics = useCastledAnalytics()

     const identify = () => {
       // Track user traits
       analytics?.identify(
         "user-12345", // unique user-id
         {
           // user traits
           fname: "hello",
           lname: "user",
           age: 34,
           email: "name@domain.com",
         }
       )
     }

     const track = () => {
       // Track user events and event properties
       analytics?.track("Added to Cart", {
         value: 30,
         currency: "USD",
         item: "product A",
       })
     }

     return (
       <div style={{ padding: "20px" }}>
         <h1>Event Tracking Demo</h1>
         <button onClick={identify}>Identify Me</button>
         <button onClick={track}>Add to Cart</button>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

3. Once you integrate the SDK and add the code snippets to enable tracking, you will be able to verify the tracking api calls in your browser by inspecting network calls.
   For e.g. following image shows an instance of `identify` call.

Castled uses
[Google Firebase Cloud Messaging(FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)
to send push and in-app messages to your Android mobile application. The
following steps will walk you through the process of setting up your application
to receive push or in-app notification from Castled. They are mainly intended
for your android app developers.

## Setting up FCM configs

- Make sure you have added Firebase to your Android project. Follow
  [Firebase doc](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) for more
  details. Within the doc the recommended approach is to follow the steps in
  [option 1](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#console)
- We need to get the **FCM Sender ID** and **FCM Server Key** from Firebase
  console which will be required for configuring the Android app in Castled.

1. After logging into Firebase console, navigate to project settings page for
   your project and select cloud messaging tab. Add a new server key if not
   already done.

2. Also make sure that the Cloud messaging API is enabled. If not click on the
   **Manage API in Google Cloud Console** button to enable it.

- Once the above step is complete navigate to **settings > channels > mobile
  push** in Castled webapp. Select Android tab. Specify an **App Name** to
  identify your app configuration and enter the **FCM Sender ID** and **FCM
  Server Key** you got from Firebase console in the previous step.

- When you save your config, you will get an `instance-id` which will be used in
  the library initialization step.

## Library installation

### Gradle

Add Castled module as a dependency in the `build.gradle` file for your Android
application module

```gradle build.gradle
...
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'io.castled:notifications:x.y.z'
}
```

where x.y.z is the latest version of the library published in MavenCentral

### Maven

Add the following snippet in your `pom.xml` file as a child of `dependencies`

```xml pom.xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.castled</groupId>
  <artifactId>notifications</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.x</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace x.y.z with the latest version of the library.

## Registering for notifications

The next step is to initialize the Castled sdk. Add the following code to your
`Application` class. `instance-id` is the one obtained when Android FCM configs
were saved in Castled webapp.

```java
public class MyTestApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
      super.onCreate();

      ...
      CastledNotifications.initialize(this, "instance-id");
      ...
  }
}
```

To let Castled know the user associated with this app instance, use the
following method. This is typically invoked immediately after user completes the
sign-in flow in your app. The `user-id` passed to Castled is the one that you
use internally within your organisation to identify a user.

```
CastledNotifications.setUserId("user-zdc1234");
```

`setUserId` can optionally take in a security token which is fetched from your
app server. This is the recommended approach to avoid any risks of user
impersonation.

## Notification default configs

SDK provides option to specify default values for some of the push notification
payload fields. You need to create a `castled.xml` file in the `res/values`
folder of your app project.

### Notification channels

Add the following values to `castled.xml` if you want to specify a default
channel for notifications from Castled. More details on android notifications
channels can be found here.

```xml castled.xml
<string name="io_castled_push_default_channel_id">YOUR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID</string>
<string name="io_castled_push_default_channel_name">YOUR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_NAME</string>
<string name="io_castled_push_default_channel_desc">YOUR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_DESC</string>
```

## Firebase push messaging handling service

By default push token registration and notification receiving are handled by
SDK. In case if you are handling `com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT` using
your own service add the following code snippets to your service class (derived
from `FirebaseMessagingService`)

### Register for push tokens

```java
public void onNewToken(@NonNull String token) {
    super.onNewToken(token);
    ...
    ...
    CastledNotifications.setToken(token);
}
```

### Handling notifictions

```java
public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {

    // This check will ensure any notification from castled is handled by SDK
    if (!CastledNotificationManager.handleNotification(this, remoteMessage)) {

        // Notification not from castled. Handle the notification here

    }
}
```

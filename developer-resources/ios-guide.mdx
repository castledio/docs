## Setting up iOS configs

You can either use a **APNS Provider Certificate** or **APNS Authentication Key** to configure iOS push notification in Castled.

<Note>
  **APNS Authentication Key** is the recommended method for sending push
  notfication to your apps running on iOS devices. It use token based
  authentication and is faster than the certificate based one. This doc has
  instructions on how to generate an **Authentication Key**
</Note>

## Uing APNS Authentication Key

This [doc](/getting-started/channel-setup/ios-auth) has more information on how to obtain **Auth key file**, **Key ID**, **Team ID** and **Bundle ID**.

## Using APNS Provider Certificate

To generate the certificate and the private key you can follow the instructions provided in the [apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)

Once you save the configs in Castled, you will get an `instance-id` which will be later used while integrating the SDK with your app.

## SDK installation

### Install from CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on macOS.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

List the dependencies in a text file named `Podfile` in your Xcode project directory. If you do not have a `Podfile` already create one using the following command.

```
pod init
```

To integrate Castled Notifications into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`

```bash Podfile
pod 'Castled', '~> 1.0.2'
```

Now you can install the dependencies in your project.

```
pod install
```

When installation is complete open the .xcworkspace that was created.

Now you can import your dependencies e.g.:

```
import Castled
```

## Registering for push notifications

Initialize the SDK by registering the `instance-id` in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of the `AppDelegate` class and calling Castled.configure

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    Castled.configure(registerIn: application, launchOptions: launchOptions, instanceId: "instance-id", delegate: self)
    ...
    return true
}
```

To let Castled know the user associated with this app instance, use the method `Castled.sharedInstance?.registerUser`. This is typically invoked immediately after user completes the sign-in flow in your app. The user-id passed to Castled is the one that you use internally within your organisation to identify a user.

```swift
Castled.sharedInstance?.registerUser(userId: userId, completion: { (_ response: CastledResponse<[String : String]>) in
  if response.success {
      print(response.result as Any)
  }
  else
  {
      print("Error is \(response.errorMessage)")
  }
})
```

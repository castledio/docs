## Introduction

WhatsApp templates enable businesses to send pre-approved messages to customers, ensuring consistency and compliance with WhatsApp's policies.

Castled requires the storage of all approved templates in our system to facilitate previews while creating a WhatsApp campaign.

## Preferred Approach - Auto Fetch

For all BSPs that provide an API for fetching approved templates, Castled automatically retrieves all approved templates and stores them for use within the platform. Additionally, there is a cron job running periodically to check for any new templates added or deleted. This ensures the Castled system is updated accordingly, thereby eliminating the need for marketers to manually replicate the templates in Castled.

## Fallback Approach - Manual Replication

For Business Service Providers (BSPs) that do not offer an API for automatic template synchronization, the templates needs to be manually replicated in Castled.

This section covers the manual process of replicating the templates within Castled.

## Preparing for template creation

Before you begin creating your template in Castled, make sure you have the following:

1. **Meta Approval:** A WhatsApp template already approved by Meta through your BSP.
2. **External Template ID:** The unique identifier provided by your BSP for the approved template.

### Basic Template Details

**Template Name:** Assign a descriptive name to your template. This name should help you easily identify the template's purpose and content at a glance.

**Provider Config:** Select the BSP configuration you're using from a dropdown list of previously configured service providers.

**External Template ID:** Enter the exact template ID as provided by your BSP. This ID links your Castled.io template with the corresponding approved version on the BSP's system.

**Message Language:** Indicate the primary language used in your message content to ensure clear communication with recipients.

### Mandatory Sections

**Body**

This is the core of your message where you engage with the recipient and is mandatory.

Clearly articulate your intent and make sure to:

    1. Maintain clarity and brevity.

    2. Insert placeholders for variable content, such as `{{1}}`, where the numbers signify the order in which variable information will be inserted. For instance, `{{1}}` could be the recipientâ€™s name, while `{{2}}` could be an appointment date.

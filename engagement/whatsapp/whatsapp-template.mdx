## Introduction

WhatsApp templates enable businesses to send pre-approved messages to customers, ensuring consistency and compliance with WhatsApp's policies.

Castled requires the storage of all approved templates in our system to facilitate previews while creating a WhatsApp campaign.

For all BSPs that provide an API for fetching approved templates, Castled automatically retrieves all approved templates and stores them for use within the platform. Additionally, there is a cron job running periodically to check for any new templates added or deleted. This ensures the Castled system is updated accordingly, thereby eliminating the need for marketers to manually replicate the templates in Castled.

This section covers the manual process of replicating the templates within Castled.io for Business Service Providers (BSPs) that do not offer an API for automatic template synchronization

## Preparing for template creation

Before you begin creating your template in Castled, make sure you have the following:

1. **Meta Approval:** A WhatsApp template already approved by Meta through your BSP.
2. **External Template ID:** The unique identifier provided by your BSP for the approved template.

### 1. Create an account with a BSP of your choice.

Register for an account with the BSP, which typically involves providing company details and contact information.Follow the BSP's onboarding process, which may include verification steps to confirm the authenticity of your business.

### 2. Get the WABA approved

Apply for a WhatsApp Business Account by providing the required business information and documents.Ensure that your business complies with WhatsAppâ€™s Commerce Policy and Business Policy.Submit your application and wait for approval. This process can take some time, as WhatsApp verifies the information provided.

### 3. Add a business phone number to the approved WABA

Obtain a dedicated business phone number to be associated with your WhatsApp Business Account.This number should be capable of receiving international SMS or calls during the verification process.It's important to note that this number will be used for all communication with customers and cannot be a personal phone number.

### 4. Configure WhatsApp Provider

A WhatsApp BSP needs to be configured in Castled to send WhatsApp campaigns. Refer [WhatsApp Provider](/settings/channel-configs/whatsapp-provider/whatsapp-overview) section for configuring the WhatsApp provider.

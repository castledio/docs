Before you can start sending WhatsApp messages through Castled using WhatsApp Service Providers (WSPs) or WhatsApp Business Solution Providers (BSP),the following are the prerequisites to sending a WhatsApp Message:

### 1. Create an account with a BSP of your choice.

Register for an account with the BSP, which typically involves providing company details and contact information.Follow the BSP's onboarding process, which may include verification steps to confirm the authenticity of your business.

### 2. Get the WABA approved

Apply for a WhatsApp Business Account by providing the required business information and documents.Ensure that your business complies with WhatsAppâ€™s Commerce Policy and Business Policy.

Submit your application and wait for approval. This process can take some time, as WhatsApp verifies the information provided.

### 3. Add a business phone number to the approved WABA

Obtain a dedicated business phone number to be associated with your WhatsApp Business Account.This number should be capable of receiving international SMS or calls during the verification process.

It's important to note that this number will be used for all communication with customers and cannot be a personal phone number.

### 4. Create and get the templates approved

Once the business account is created and the phone number has been added to the WABA, you'll need to create the necessary templates and have them approved by Meta before using them in campaigns.

Refer [WhatsApp Template](/engagement/whatsapp/whatsapp-template) section for using the approved templates in Castled.

### 5. Configure WhatsApp Provider

A WhatsApp BSP needs to be configured in Castled to send WhatsApp campaigns. 

Refer [WhatsApp Provider](/settings/channel-configs/whatsapp-provider/whatsapp-overview) section for configuring the WhatsApp provider.

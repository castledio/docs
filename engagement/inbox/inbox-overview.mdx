### What is App Inbox?

The App Inbox is a dedicated space within your mobile application that houses a curated list of messages for the user. Unlike transient notifications such as push or in-app messages, the App Inbox offers a persistent store, ensuring messages aren't easily overlooked and can be referred back to at the user's convenience.

### Objective of App Inbox
The primary aim of the App Inbox is to enhance user engagement by delivering targeted and persistent content directly within the app environment. This is especially beneficial for content that users might want to reference multiple times or at their own pace. By having a repository of messages, marketers can ensure vital information isn't lost in the flood of daily notifications.

### Benefits for Marketers

**Enhanced Engagement:** With a dedicated space for your messages, users can engage at their convenience, ensuring better message consumption.

**Retention:** Persistent messages can act as reminders for users about pending actions, offers, or updates, potentially increasing app retention rates.

**Segmentation & Personalization:** Marketers can curate content based on user preferences, behavior, or demographics, ensuring relevance.

**Centralized Messaging:** A consolidated place for all important messages reduces the risk of message fatigue from other channels like push or in-app messages.

**Analytical Insights:** By tracking which messages are viewed, saved, or deleted, marketers can gain insights into user preferences and behavior.

### Major use cases for App Inbox

**Complementary to Push:** A user receives a push notification about a limited-time sale. If they ignore it, they can later find detailed information about the sale in their App Inbox.

**Extending In-App Messages:** After presenting a brief in-app message about a new feature, detailed instructions or tutorials can be stored in the App Inbox for users to refer back to.

**Drip Content Campaigns:** Spread out content delivery, like a series of tutorials or stories, which users can access sequentially from their App Inbox.

**Seasonal Catalogs:** Instead of fleeting promotions, offer seasonal catalogs or lookbooks in the App Inbox that users can browse at leisure.

**Feedback & Surveys:** While an initial prompt can be made via in-app messages, detailed feedback forms or surveys can reside in the App Inbox, allowing users to fill them out when they have the time.

### Inbox Message Types

In our App Inbox, we aim to offer diverse message formats to cater to your users' varying preferences and to deliver the content in the most engaging way. The design choices ensure that your messages not only capture attention but also deliver your intended message seamlessly. Let's delve into the distinct message styles that you can leverage:

**Normal Message**

The conventional message type is envisaged as a banner-like structure within the App Inbox. These messages come in three specific variations:

1. **Banner without Icon**

<img style={{height: "100px"}} src="/images/inbox/inbox-2.png" />

![](/images/inbox/inbox-2.png)

This is a minimalist design that focuses purely on the message content without any distractions.

2. **Banner with Icon**

Accompanied by an icon, this message type gives a visual hint to users, making the message more intuitive and engaging.

3. **Message with Media**

A richer format, this supports the inclusion of media elements, be it images, videos, or audio clips. Perfect for when you want the message to be more illustrative or engaging.

### App Inbox Message Types

In our App Inbox, we aim to offer diverse message formats to cater to your users' varying preferences and to deliver the content in the most engaging way. The design choices ensure that your messages not only capture attention but also deliver your intended message seamlessly. Let's delve into the distinct message styles that you can leverage:

**Normal Message**

The conventional message type is envisaged as a banner-like structure within the App Inbox. These messages come in three specific variations:

1. **Basic Message**

The Basic Message is a text-based notification, primarily consisting of a title and a description. It's the simplest form of message and is typically used for straightforward communications. Detailed instructions can be accessed [here](/engagement/inbox/inbox-basic-message).

**Components:**

**Message Title:** The primary heading or subject of the message.

**Message:** A detailed text expanding on the title or providing additional context.

**Usage:**

- Informative updates
- Reminders or alerts
- General announcements

2. **Basic Message with Icon**

This is similar to the Basic Message but includes an icon to visually represent the content or source of the message. Icons can aid in quickly identifying the message type or category. Detailed instructions can be accessed [here](/engagement/inbox/inbox-basic-message-icon)

**Components:**

**Icon:** A visual representation or symbol related to the message content. It helps users quickly identify the type or category of the message.

**Message Title:** The primary heading or subject of the message.

**Message:** A detailed text expanding on the title or providing additional context.

**Usage:**

- Brand-specific notifications
- Categorized updates (e.g., a shopping cart icon for purchase-related messages)
- Visual emphasis on certain messages

3. **Message with Media**

The Message with Media integrates visual elements like images or videos alongside a title and description. This combination of rich media with concise text allows for a vibrant yet informative user experience.Detailed instructions can be accessed [here](/engagement/inbox/inbox-message-with-media)

**Components:**

**Message Title:** A brief heading that gives context or introduces the media. It's the first thing users see and should be compelling enough to grab attention.

**Message:** A supplementary text providing more details about the media. It can be a caption for the image/video, additional information, or a call to action.

**Image:** The central element, either an image, offering a visual or multi-sensory experience to the user.

**Usage:**

- Showcasing new products with a brief introduction.
- Announcing events with a teaser video, accompanied by event details.
- Sharing user testimonials or reviews with an image and a summary.

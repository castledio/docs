Usually, when you create a workflow, you specify a segment of users for whom the workflow should be applicable.
However, in the case of event-triggered workflows, selecting a segment is optional.
A typical use case is designing a user onboarding workflow, where the new user is not part of any existing segments.

Please find below a quick overview of creating workflow without a segment

## 1. Trigger Event Selection

Select `Event Triggered` as the workflow type. Select the event to trigger the workflow from the event dropdown. Dropdown is populated first time an event of a specific type is logged.
Optionally you can further restrict the trigger by adding conditions based on event properties using the `Add Condition` button.

## 2. Segment Selection

Skip the segment selection by clicking `Proceed without Segment` and proceed to the next step. Rest of the steps are similar to any other workflow

## 3. Adding Workflow Steps and Personalization

Once you are in the workflow canvas, you can add any required step. Messaging content can be personalized using event parameters.

## Reserved Fields in Trigger Event

Since the user is not part of any segment yet, all fields required for personalization are expected to be in the `properties` object within the trigger event.

The following fields within the `properties` map are reserved:

- email: Mandatory to assign the user's email to this field when the workflow has a step to send an email. Otherwise, the email step will be skipped for the user.
- phone: Mandatory to assign the user's phone number to this field when the workflow has a step to send an SMS or WhatsApp message.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if trigger event gets reported for the same user more than once">
    When the trigger event is reported for a user for the first time, the user
    enters the workflow. Any subsequent trigger events reported for the user are
    ignored if the user is already active in the workflow. If the trigger event
    is reported for a user who has already exited the workflow, the default
    behavior is to not re-enter the workflow. However, this is configurable.
    Contact support for more details.

<Accordion title="How long does it take to start the workflow for a user once trigger event is reported">
  Workflow starts instantaneously for the user typically with sub-seconds
  latency.

### Creating customer journeys using Workflow 

Workflows, frequently termed as 'Customer Journeys', outline a structured multi-step process that orchestrates user experiences across a timeline. They encompass a series of planned interactions, allowing for targeted and timely user engagement. 

By leveraging workflows, you can create a curated path, triggering specific actions or messages based on user behavior, preferences, or set intervals, thereby ensuring a more personalized and effective communication strategy.

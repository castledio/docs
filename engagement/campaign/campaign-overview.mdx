**What:** Specifies the core message or call-to-action of the campaign. What do you want these users to know, understand, or do?

**When:** Details the timing or duration of the campaign. When will this campaign be launched and for how long will it run?

**Where:** Describes the channels where the campaign will be rolled out. Where will users encounter this campaign? This could include channels like email, in-app messages, push notifications, etc.

**Why:** Explains the primary goal or objectives behind the campaign. Why are you running this campaign? What is the expected outcome or desired behavior from the users?

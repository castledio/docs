## Schema / Object

This section discuss how to configure Schema/Object in Castled. Castled allows to create the following types of schemas.

1. **User Schema**: User or Contact schema is the fundamental schema in any marketing automation tool. Creation and maintenance is covered
   in detail [here](/schema/user).

2. **Event Schema**: Event schema is vital for driving the marketing campaigns based on the user actions in the application.Creation and maintenance is covered
   in detail [here](/schema/event).

3. **Custom Schema**: Custom schema gives you the flexibility to create custom objects which are related to the User schema based on your business needs. This gives the marketers the flexibility to segment the campaign audience based on the logical relationship rather than waiting on the data team to create custom attributes for some relationship requirements.Creation and maintenance is covered in detail [here](/schema/custom).

### Whitelisting Castled IP Address

Castled connects to Hydra using the ip address **34.205.244.96**. Please make
sure this ip is allowed inbound traffic to the Hydra port.

### Connecting to SSH Tunnel

Castled uses SSH Tunelling to connect in cases where Hydra is accessible only on
private or internal networks. In order to make sure the connection is
established successfully with SSH Tunneling, you need to provide an SSH Host
visible on the public internet and at the same time connect to your private
Hydra warehouse. The basic admin actions mentioned below are required for the
same

1. Create a new user for Castled on the SSH Host (This user account is not
   related to the user account created for database related operations.
   Recommend using the same account name , but can be kept different if you
   want)
2. While configuring a new warehouse connector for Hydra on the ‘Create
   Connector’, you need to enter the following details
   - SSH Host IP/DNS Name
   - SSH Port : Default is 22 unless changed
   - SSH Username : User created for Castled on the SSH Host Docusaurus

3. On successful creation of the new Connector , Castled will generate a key
   pair fo the SSH authentication . Refer Connecting through SSH Tunnel for
   details on how to add the castled public key to authorized_keys.

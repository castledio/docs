### Permission Details

**Create a dedicated user CASTLED for connecting to your Redshift warehouse.For
making sure the connection is established successfully the CASTLED user created

1. Required grants to create a new schema CASTLED with all required privileges
   to create/update/delete tables with in that schema.
2. **READ ONLY** access to the existing as well as future tables and views in
   the schemas from which you want Castled to sync the data to your destination
   app.
3. Permission to execute the existing as well as future functions in the schema
   from which you want Castled to sync the data to your destination app. You can
   use the below script to configure the required access required by Castled.

```
-----------------------------------USER CREATON STARTS-------------------------------------------------------
â€” Create a new user CASTLED for connecting to redshift DB
CREATE USER CASTLED WITH PASSWORD '<strong, unique password>';
-----------------------------------USER CREATON ENDS----------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------BOOK KEEPING SCHEMA ACCESS STARTS------------------------------------------
-- Create a private bookkeeping schema for storing sync data
CREATE SCHEMA CASTLED;

-- Give the CASTLED user full access to the bookkeeping schema
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA CASTLED TO CASTLED;

-- Give CASTLED user access to all objects existing n the bookkeeping schema
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CASTLED TO CASTLED;

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<your schema>" TO CASTLED;

-- Give READ ONLY access to  CASTLED user to read from all existing tables in your schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<your schema>" TO CASTLED;

-- Give READ ONLY access to CASTLED user to read from all the future tables being created in your schema

### Whitelisting Castled IP Address

Castled connects to Redshift using the ip address **34.205.244.96**. Please make
sure this ip is allowed inbound traffic to the Redshift port.

### Connecting to SSH Tunnel

Castled uses SSH Tunelling to connect to Redshift clusters accessible only on
private or internal networks. In order to make sure the connection is
established successfully with SSH Tunneling, you need to provide an SSH Host
visible on the public internet which can also connect to the private Redshift
warehouse. The basic admin actions mentioned below are required for the same

While configuring a new warehouse connector for Redshift on the 'Create

1. SSH Host IP/DNS Name
2. SSH Port : Default is 22 unless changed
3. SSH Username : User created for Castled on the SSH Host Docusaurus Refer
   Connecting through SSH Tunnel for details on how to add the castled public

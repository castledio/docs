Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a cloud-based email service that provides cost-effective, flexible and scalable way for businesses of all sizes to keep in contact with their customers through email.

## Configuring AWS SES

    You can skip this step if you already have your AWS SES setup

    1. Sign Up for AWS: If you haven’t already, create an AWS account.

    2. Verify Email Addresses or Domains: Before sending emails, verify your email addresses or domains through the SES console.

    3. Request Production Access: Initially, your SES account is in a sandbox environment. Request production access to remove restrictions and enable full email sending capabilities.

    For detailed guidance, you should refer to the official [AWS SES documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/Welcome.html).

## Setting up SNS for email events

SNS allows you to receive notifications for SES events such as email deliveries, bounces, and complaints.
Castled user these notifications to provide detailed insights and real-time alerts on your email sending activities and also
efficiently adjusting email sending practices based on bounce or complaint notifications.

Setting up Amazon SNS for SES events involves a few key steps:

    1. Create an SNS Topic Subscription:
       - Go to the Amazon SNS dashboard.
       - Choose **Create topic** and define the topic name and display name.
       - Create a **Subscription** and configure the Castled webhook `https://api.castled.io/backend/v1/email-webhook/sns` to receive SNS events as below.
         **Enable raw message delivery** should be unchecked.

       - Once subscription is setup, Castled automatically completes the subscription confirmation with AWS SNS. If the **Status** is `Pending` after 30 mins, try **Request confirmation** again.

       - Choose the identity for which you want to set notifications.
       - Under **Notifications**, select **Edit Configuration**.
       - For each type of notification (Bounces, Complaints, Deliveries), select the SNS topic you created.
         Make sure to check **Include original email headers**

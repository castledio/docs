## Introduction

WhatsApp templates enable businesses to send pre-approved messages to customers, ensuring consistency and compliance with WhatsApp's policies. This guide details the process of setting up these templates within Castled.io for Business Service Providers (BSPs) that do not automatically sync approved templates through an API.

## Preparing for Template Creation

Before you begin crafting your template, make sure you have the following:
1. Meta Approval: A WhatsApp template already approved by Meta through your BSP.
2. External Template ID: The unique identifier provided by your BSP for the approved template.

## Creating a Template in Castled

### Accessing the Template Creation Section
Log In: Enter your credentials on the Castled.io login page to access your account.
Navigation: Locate and click on the 'WhatsApp Templates' or similar section within your dashboard.
Initiation: Click the 'Create Template' button to start defining your new template.

### Providing Template Details

**Template Name:** Assign a descriptive name to your template. This name should help you easily identify the template's purpose and content at a glance.

**Provider Config:** Select the BSP configuration you're using from a dropdown list of previously configured service providers.

**External Template ID:** Enter the exact template ID as provided by your BSP. This ID links your Castled.io template with the corresponding approved version on the BSP's system.

**Message Language:** Indicate the primary language used in your message content to ensure clear communication with recipients.

### Constructing the Template

**Mandatory Body Section**

1. Message Text: This is the core of your message where you engage with the recipient. Clearly articulate your intent and make sure to:
Maintain clarity and brevity.
Insert placeholders for variable content, such as {{1}}, where the numbers signify the order in which variable information will be inserted. For instance, {{1}} could be the recipient’s name, while {{2}} could be an appointment date.

**Optional Components**

**1. Header:**

Check the 'Header' option to include a header in your template. The header is the first thing your recipient will see, so it should be attention-grabbing.

Select the type of header:

**Text:** For a simple textual message, like a greeting or subject line.

**Media:** To make the message more engaging, you can opt for an image, video, or document. Ensure the media complies with WhatsApp's formatting requirements and size limitations.

1. Image: Upload a relevant image. You might need to provide a link or media ID that refers to an image previously uploaded to the BSP’s media library.

2. Video: Similarly, for videos, provide the appropriate link or ID.

3. Document: If the document header is relevant to your message, ensure it is a supported file type and include the necessary reference.

4. Location: Sending a location can be particularly useful for event invites or directions to a business.

**Footer:**

The footer is not as prominently displayed as the header but is essential for additional information or disclaimers.
If a footer is appropriate for your template, check the option and input the text. This might include a company tagline, disclaimer, or instructions like "Reply STOP to unsubscribe."

**Buttons:**

Buttons are a powerful way to drive interaction and action from your message recipients. If your message strategy includes calls-to-action, you can add up to two buttons per message.
Decide on the type of button:

1. **Call to Action: This button type is used when you want the recipient to take a specific action, such as visiting a website or calling a number.
    a. Website Redirection: Include a URL to direct customers to your webpage for more information, to make a purchase, or any other online activity.
    b. Call Phone Number: Use this option if you want to encourage calls to a specific number, making it easy for customers to reach out with a single tap.

2. Quick Reply: Use this for common or expected responses to streamline communication.
For each button, specify the text that will appear on it. This text should be direct and action-oriented, like "Learn More" or "Call Now".
